### Ground rules
Make sure the following rules are followed when committing to this repo:
- **fix:** a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- **feat:** a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example  `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
